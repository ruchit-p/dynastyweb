# Pino Logger Implementation Report

## Overview

This report outlines the implementation of Pino logger in the DynastyWeb application according to the guidelines provided in the `pino_logger.mdc` Cursor rule. The implementation focused on structured logging, error tracking, performance monitoring, and integrating both server and client-side logging.

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Logger Configuration

- **✅ Updated the Pino logger configuration** in `src/lib/logger.ts` to follow best practices
- **✅ Fixed TypeScript linter issues** by replacing `Record<string, any>` with `Record<string, unknown>`

### 2. Error Handling and Tracking

- **✅ Enhanced error handler** in `src/lib/error-handler.ts` to properly categorize and log errors
- **✅ Created standard patterns** for tracking errors and critical error tagging
- **✅ Integrated with error boundaries** like `global-error.tsx` to catch and log client-side errors
- **✅ Added a reusable ErrorBoundary component** for client-side error catching and reporting

### 3. Performance Monitoring

- **✅ Created a performance monitoring utility** in `src/lib/performance.ts` with functions:
  - `measureOperation`: Tracks execution times of operations
  - `measureAsync`: Wraps async functions with performance tracking
  - `apiPerformanceHandler`: Provides start/end functions for API routes

### 4. Server-Side Logging

- **✅ Enhanced middleware logging** in `src/middleware.ts` to use structured logging with Pino
- **✅ Improved Supabase client logging** in `src/lib/server/supabase.ts` to provide better context
- **✅ Implemented API route logging** for the `family-tree` endpoint
- **✅ Added structured logging to the `realtime` API endpoint** with performance tracking
- **✅ Replaced console.logs in the `api/family-tree/route.ts` with structured logging**
- **✅ Enhanced family-tree API routes with structured logging and performance monitoring**:
  - Added performance tracking to all family tree API endpoints
  - Implemented structured logging for authentication errors
  - Added detailed logging for transaction management (begin, commit, rollback)
  - Enhanced error handling with proper error classification
  - Added context metadata (user IDs, tree IDs, invitation IDs) to all log entries
  - Implemented success logging with relevant context for better traceability

### 5. Client-Side Logging

- **✅ Created client-side logger** in `src/lib/client/logger.ts` that can:
  - Show logs in browser console in development
  - Forward logs to the server in production
  - Create component-specific loggers with context
- **✅ Added server-side endpoint** at `src/app/api/log/route.ts` for receiving client logs
- **✅ Implemented client logging** in the following components and utilities:
  - `ProtectedRoute` component for authentication flow tracking
  - `AuthContext` provider for comprehensive auth event tracking
  - `FamilyMemberSelect` component for member selection events
  - `storyUtils` utility functions for story-related operations
  - `storage.ts` utilities for file operations with detailed context
  - `auth-service.ts` client-side authentication service
  - **✅ `useRealtimeUpdates.ts` hook with comprehensive connection monitoring and error handling**
  - **✅ `useStories.ts` hook for story-related operations (completed)**
  - **✅ `LocationPicker.tsx` component for location selection with proper error handling**
  - **✅ `AudioRecorder.tsx` component for audio recording operations with error handling**

### 6. Error Boundary

- **✅ Created a reusable `ErrorBoundary` component** in `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`:

## Usage Examples

### Server-Side Logging

```typescript
// Import the logger
import logger from '@/lib/logger';

// Basic info logging with structured data
logger.info({
  msg: 'User login successful',
  userId: user.id,
  method: 'POST',
  endpoint: '/api/auth/login'
});

// Error logging with context
logger.error({
  msg: 'Authentication failed',
  error: {
    message: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    name: error.name
  },
  userId: attemptedUserId
});
```

### Family Tree API Logging

```typescript
// API performance handler usage
export async function POST() {
  const perfHandler = apiPerformanceHandler('POST /api/family-tree/create');
  
  try {
    // API implementation
    
    // Success logging
    logger.info({
      msg: 'Successfully created family tree and history book',
      userId: user.id,
      treeId: treeData.id,
      historyBookId: historyBookData.id,
      endpoint: '/api/family-tree/create'
    });

    // End performance tracking with success status
    perfHandler.end('success', { userId: user.id, treeId: treeData.id });
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      treeId: treeData.id,
      historyBookId: historyBookData.id
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling and logging
    const dbError = new DatabaseError('Failed to create family tree and history book');
    await handleError(dbError, { 
      originalError: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
      userId: user.id,
      endpoint: '/api/family-tree/create'
    });
    
    // End performance tracking with error status
    perfHandler.end('error', { error: 'transaction_error' });
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to create family tree and history book' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

```typescript
import { measureAsync, apiPerformanceHandler } from '@/lib/performance';

// For async functions
const result = await measureAsync(
  'Database query operation', 
  () => fetchDataFromDatabase(id),
  { queryId: id }
);

// For API routes
export async function GET() {
  const perf = apiPerformanceHandler('GET /api/data');
  
  try {
    // API logic here
    perf.end('success', { additionalMetrics });
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    perf.end('error', { error: error.message });
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### Server Actions with Request IDs

```typescript
'use server'

import logger from '@/lib/logger';
import { measureAsync } from '@/lib/performance';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

export async function serverAction(formData: FormData) {
  return await measureAsync('serverAction', async () => {
    const requestId = uuidv4();
    
    try {
      logger.info({
        msg: 'Starting server action',
        requestId,
        input: { id: formData.get('id') }
      });
      
      // Action logic here
      const result = await performOperation(formData);
      
      logger.info({
        msg: 'Server action completed successfully',
        requestId,
        resultId: result.id
      });
      
      return { success: true, data: result };
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error({
        msg: 'Server action failed',
        requestId,
        error: error instanceof Error ? {
          message: error.message,
          stack: error.stack,
          name: error.name
        } : String(error),
        input: { id: formData.get('id') }
      });
      
      return { success: false, error: 'Operation failed' };
    }
  });
}
```

### Client-Side Logging

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/client/logger';

// Create component-specific logger
const logger = createLogger('MyComponent');

// Use in components
function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    logger.info('Component mounted', { props: componentProps });
    
    return () => {
      logger.debug('Component unmounted');
    };
  }, []);
  
  // Error handling
  try {
    // Component logic
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Component error', { 
      error: error.message,
      componentState: currentState 
    });
  }
}
```

### Client-Side Event Source Monitoring

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/lib/client/logger';

const logger = createLogger('RealtimeUpdates');

// Monitoring EventSource connections
eventSource.onopen = () => {
  logger.info('Connection established', { 
    userId: user.id,
    readyState: eventSource.readyState 
  });
};

eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
  logger.error('Connection error', { 
    userId: user.id,
    readyState: eventSource.readyState,
    error: error instanceof ErrorEvent ? error.message : 'Unknown error'
  });
  
  // Reconnection logic
};

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    logger.debug('Message received', { 
      type: data.type,
      entityId: data.entityId 
    });
    // Process data
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to parse data', { 
      error: error.message,
      eventData: event.data
    });
  }
};
```

### Using the Error Boundary

```tsx
import ErrorBoundary from '@/components/ErrorBoundary';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary componentName="MyPage">
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

The implementation of Pino logger in the DynastyWeb application continues to make significant progress. Key achievements since the last update include:

1. **Completed Story Management Server Actions**:
   - Implemented structured logging with unique request IDs in all story-related server actions
   - Added comprehensive error handling with proper context in all functions
   - Wrapped all server actions with performance monitoring using `measureAsync`
   - Added detailed logging for authentication verification and ownership checks

2. **Fixed Type Issues**:
   - Resolved type errors related to the UUID library by installing `@types/uuid`
   - Fixed unused variable warnings in server actions
   - Addressed function parameter type mismatches

3. **Enhanced Logging Patterns**:
   - Implemented consistent logging patterns across all story management functions
   - Added request IDs for better traceability between related log entries
   - Included relevant context in all log messages (user IDs, story IDs, etc.)
   - Used appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error) based on message importance

The next priorities are to implement logging in the remaining API routes, complete the family tree management server actions, and add error boundaries to page components. The production setup for logging should also be configured based on the provided guide.

The implementation is now providing valuable telemetry for user authentication flows, family tree operations, and story management, which will be crucial for diagnosing issues in production and monitoring system performance.
