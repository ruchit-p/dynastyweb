## 🔧 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project (for development)
- Firebase CLI (for secret management)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your Firebase configuration:

```
# Firebase Configuration (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-firebase-measurement-id
```

### Secret Management

Dynasty uses Firebase Secret Manager for secure environment variables in Cloud Functions:

1. Set secrets using Firebase CLI:
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set YOUR_SECRET_NAME
```

2. For local development, create a `.secret.local` file in your functions directory with your secrets in KEY=value format:
```
SECRET_NAME_1=secret_value_1
SECRET_NAME_2=secret_value_2
```

The Firebase Emulator Suite will automatically load these secrets when running locally.

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

For development with Firebase Emulators:

```bash
npm run dev:emulator
# or
yarn dev:emulator
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
